GPU-Accelerated MapReduce-Based Self-Organizing Maps

Please note that this project has been superseded by

https://github.com/peterwittek/somoclu

Example usage with two GPUs:

mpirun -np 2 ./mrsom data/rgbs.txt data/rgbs

The input is a plain-text dense matrix, where the rows correspond to the instances.

You will need CUDA, MPI, and MR-MPI to compile the code. MR-MPI is available at:
http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/download.html

The code was derived from the MR-MPI SOM implementation by Seung-Jin Sul:

The GPU setting method for a distributed system is based on GPMR by Jeff Stuart:
